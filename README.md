# 📘 What is MPC? | Model Predictive Control Explained

Welcome to the **"What is MPC?"** repository! 🚀 This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**, a cutting-edge control strategy widely used in engineering, robotics, and AI systems.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Model Predictive Control (MPC)** is an advanced control method that:

* **Predicts** future system behavior over a defined time horizon.
* **Optimizes** control inputs to achieve desired outcomes while respecting constraints.
* **Updates** predictions and control actions in real-time, making it ideal for dynamic and uncertain environments.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

* **Nonlinear and Economic MPC**: Tailored for complex systems with nonlinear dynamics.
* **Support for Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE)**: Enables modeling of systems with algebraic constraints.
* **Robust Multi-Stage MPC**: Incorporates uncertainty through scenario trees to ensure constraint satisfaction.
* **Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE)**: Provides real-time state estimation for improved control accuracy.
* **Modular Design**: Easily extendable components for simulation, estimation, and control applications.
